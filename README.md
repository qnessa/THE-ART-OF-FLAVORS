Project Initial ERD and data base design
















Miro Board

The Miro Board was used for iteration allowing me to have a broad picture on the project begging until its ending by adding all the posts, related images and the technologies that will be used.


Balsamiq

Balsamiq was used to design the initial idea of the art of flavors blog including user features, navigation and placeholders for pictures that would be included within the blog. Some alterations are made to improve the user experience while improving the platform responsivness.















Lucid Chart

Lucid chart was used as a visual map of the platform enabling to visualise the project.
















Github project

I used Github project for the User Stories. However, 11 out of the 12 user stories were completed leaving the review section with star ratings to the next iteration.
















Features

Posts, Account creation and Reader Comments












Styling frontend development

- Clean and Appetizing Design:

CSS, Bootstrap and HTML were used to complete the project with a clean and visually appealing design showcasing appetizing food photography. High-quality images of dishes to draw readers in and make them want to explore the content further.

- Color Palette:

A color palette that complements the food imagery and evokes the desired mood or atmosphere. Soft, natural tones can create a warm and inviting feel, while vibrant colors can add energy and excitement. 

- Typography:

Courier New was used for for  good readability and legibility characteristics. Its monospaced design ensures consistent spacing between characters, which can aid in clarity, especially for longer blocks of text for the blog contents. My choice of Courier New was emphasised by it conveying a sense of authenticity or tradition in our content. It might be perceived as a font that harkens back to simpler times or homemade recipes passed down through generations. Moreover, Courier New is used for its branding, and therefore, it may carry over into the blog's typography for consistency across various brand elements enabling to achieve an aesthetic, convey a particular traditional tone and identity of the blog.



Fixed Bugs

Summernote stops the display of posts content type in Posts Admin Screen.











The code higlighted in the post model above displayed the post content type on the admin page. This was broken by Summernote. However, I have managed to fix it by            improving its functionality.
